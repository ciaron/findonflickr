findonflickr.py version 0.1

WHAT THIS DOES
==============
Flickr filenames are of the form "3918794531_da13193ee2_o.jpg". The first
part ("3918794531") is a unique photo ID, (and represents where in the
sequence of uploads to Flickr this image was) so, using the 
http://flickr.com/photo.gne?id=PHOTOID trick, we can get directly to the
photo page.

[The other parts of the filename - "da13193ee2" and "o" - are a secret hash
for that image and image size respectively]


INSTALLING
==========
This is an extension to Nautilus. Copy to your .nautilus/python-extensions
folder and restart Nautilus. You will also need to have the python-nautilus
Python bindings installed.  You will see a new item in the context menu
when you right-click on an image called "Find on Flickr..." Clicking this
will opening the Flickr photo page (assuming you have permissions to view
that image) in your default browser.

Testing on Ubuntu Karmic 9.10 with Nautilus 2.28.1
